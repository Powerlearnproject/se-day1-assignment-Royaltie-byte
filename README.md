Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  software engineering is the process of designing ,developing,testing and maintaining software using engineering principles to ensure its reliability,
  efficiency and scalability.
  IMPORTANCE IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY.
  1.Leads to the development of high quality software
  2.Leads to saving time and cost with structured methodologies.
  3.Leads to the development of scalable and secure software.
  4.Supports innovation among the people doing it.

  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1.The birth of software engineering itself-this was when the word software engineering came to light and it was first considered as a discipline rather than just an ad-hoc
  practice
  2.The development of structured programming- this made software engineering easier since it improved code readability and maintainability.
  3.The agile revolution- this was a revolution thaat came about in the 2000 s and increased the flecibility and collaboration in this discipline hence proving 
  to be a key milestone.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-the project goals and plans are defined.
2.Requirement analysis- all the requirements needed for the system are checked and gathered.
3.Design - the system architecture of the projedt is designed.
4.Implementation - the actual code  for the software is written
5.Testing -  bugs are checked and the programs fuctionality is tested.
6.Deployment - the made software is made accessible to the users so they can test it and give their reviews.
7.Maintenance and Updates - issues that may have been missed are fixed and updates are done in this part.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach of software development wherby the program is built step by step where 
  one part is finished first before starting another part and the profect is made available to the users after it is compleeted fully while Agile 
  methodology is  an iterative and incremental approach to software development where by small working portions are frequently updated and release to the users
  since it mostly makes use of user collaborations and reviews.
  A waterfall methodology would be appropriate in a project with a fixed scope and clear requirements while the agile methodology would be appropriate in dynamic 
  projects which are mostly user driven and need frequent changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 1.SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
   The software developer writes and maintains code based on the design of the program .The developer also fixes bugs and collaborates with others in
   making the program
 2.QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER.
   performs manual and automated testings on the developed software and ensures that the software has met the quality standards.
 3.PROJECT MANAGER.
   The project manager plans , tracks and manages profect timelines,scope and the budget ensuring that the deadlines and objectives of the project 
   are met.
 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide a suitable place to write, debug and test code.Example is Visual Studio Code.
  Version Control Systems (VCS) help in tracking chages made to code ,helps manage versions and also allows engineers to work collaboratively without
  any conflicts.Example Git.
  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1.Keeping track of rapidly emerging technologies like new programming languages ,frameworks and tools .This can be overcomed by continuous learning
  and involving oneself with developer communities for updates.
  2.Identifying and fixing bugs efficiently especially in large and complex programs.This can be overcomed by using good debugging tools.
  3.Managing complex code bases - large and complex code bases can be arduous to understand and maintain.This can be overcomed by following
  principles for writing clean code and also using modularization practices to improve on readability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1.UNIT TESTING - this is testing that is done to individual units or functions in a program.
  2.INTEGRATION TESTING - this is testing where many modules are tested together to see if they work together in a good manner
     as expected.
  3.SYSTEM TESTING - evaluates the functionality of the complete system and mimics a real world usage.
  4.ACCEPTANCE TESTING - this is testing done by end-users whereby after they apprive that the software meets market standards
    tes software is therefore ready for deployment.
    The above methods are important in that , they ensure that a certain product meets the standards that are in the market and also 
    ensures that the developed softwaare functions properly before releasing it to the actual users in the market.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input messages to AI models to increase the accuracy and relevance of the responses
  of these AI models.
  This practice is important in that it leads to the generation of relevant information from these models leading to enhanced efficiency 
  and productivity and also ensures proper utilization of these AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  VAGUE PROMPT- Generate a forestry essay .
  VIVID PROMPT- Generate a forestry essay not less than 150 words that focuses mainly on issues related to forestry in the Canada,
    The improved prompt is more effective since it will provide more relevant results to me and it will provide things that i specifically
    want hence suiting my needs better than the vague prompt.
